# Knapsack-Problem
A Python script to view the Knapsack Problem with Streamlit
[Knapsack Problem APP with Streamlit](https://knapsack-problem.streamlit.app/)

# Definition
The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total value of items placed in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Each item has a specific weight and value, and the challenge is to determine the optimal combination of items to include in the knapsack.

# Algorithm
This implementation uses a greedy algorithm approach to solve the Knapsack problem. The algorithm sorts items based on their value-to-weight ratio and iteratively adds them to the knapsack until the weight limit is reached.

# Usage
To run the Streamlit application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run Algoritmo_Codicioso.py
```
Make sure you have Streamlit installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```
# Features
- Interactive user interface to input item weights, values, and knapsack capacity.
- Visualization of the selected items and total value.
- Step-by-step explanation of the greedy algorithm used to solve the problem.
# Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Streamlit library
